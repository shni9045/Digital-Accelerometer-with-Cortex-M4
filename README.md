# Digital-Accelerometer-with-Cortex-M4

## This is the starter code for interfacing 3-axis ADXL345 accelrometer with Texas Instruments MSP432 (Cortex M4F) using SPI protocol.
* Using this starter code one can set a activity threshold along any of the 3 axis with 62.5 mg/LSB scale factor and generate an interrupt.
* One can also set Tap interrupts for accelrometer using this code.
* Lastly it is also possible to retrieve data from the FIFO along any axis.
